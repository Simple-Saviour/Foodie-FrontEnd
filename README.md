# Foodie - A Food Ordering Website

## Introduction
Foodie is a food ordering website which is aimed at developing an online ordering system for use in the food service industry which will allow the restaurants to quickly and easily manage an online menu which customers can browse and use to place orders with just a few clicks. It provides convenience for the general busy people of the society as it overcomes the demerits of the manual hotel or mess system and the old-fashioned queuing system.

## Features

1. It has a Login/SignUp feature where user can enter their details while will be saved in the database of the project.
2. It has an 'Add to Cart' feature where user can select their food items and add them to this cart for checking it out.
3. It has a 'MyOrders' section which stores the history of the food orders of the users.
   
## Point of Improvement

1. It still requires a payment gateway to be integrated into it so as to enable the users to pay for their ordered food.
2. The admin panel is still missing in this project which is quite essentia for successful execution of this project.
3. The FrontEnd part still needs a lot of improvements and the UI can be improved and enhanced.
   
## Importance

Through this project, I tried to reduce the rift between the busy people of today’s society and the overcrowded restaurants and also made it easy for the people to have their food in their desired location at their desired time.
It is also extremely beneficial for college students as it enables students to place orders while they’re studying in the library, attending seminars or envolved in other activities.
With the introduction of this website in the food industry system, it will prove to be a revolution in  the food sector and will be useful for restaurants and their customers and will clench the hunger of several people and fulfill their appetite.
Through this website, I aim to save time for both customers and the restaurants, increase the visibility and reach of the restaurants and lower the cost of advertising and marketing by the restaurants.
